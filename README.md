## Project Description:

+ This project is the initial foray into the world of Web Design / Development,as part of the Holberton School - Higher-level programming track, focusing solely on the back-end of our website

+ As such, it consists of building and implenting a command line interpreter and file storage back-end
to allow us, as developers, to manipulate and store data sans visual interface(GUI), similar to a shell

+ In effect, we are implementing a test environment to ensure our file storage system works, to later be migrated to a MySQL database


## Project Goals / Concepts Learned

+ Create a Python package
+ Create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module
+ Learn Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
+ How to write and read to/from a `JSON` file - serialization and deserialization (of a Class)
+ How to manage `datetime` and `UUID`
+ Utilizing `*args` and more specifically, `**kwargs` - to handle named arguments passed as function parameters


## Functionality

+ Creates an object (instance of defined BaseModel Class - as described below)
+ Implements data model of previously created instance
+ Allows manipulation and management of objects/instances (via the following commands):
++ `Create`
++ `Update`
++ `Destroy`
++ `New`
++ `All`
+ Store files in JSON format - via serialization and deserialization

## Usage / Execution







### Environment
+ Our HBNB Clone has been interpreted/compiled/tested on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
+ Written and tested utilizing `Python3 (Version 3.4.3)` and `PEP 8 Styling`
