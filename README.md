## Project Description:

+ This project is the initial foray into the world of Web Design / Development,
as part of the Holberton School - Higher-level programming track

+ This project focuses solely on the back-end of our website

+ As such, it consists of building and implenting a command line interpreter and file storage back-end
+ to allow us, as developers, to manipulate and store data sans visual interface(GUI), similar to a shell

+ In effect, we are implementing a test environment to ensure our file storage system works, to later be migrated to a MySQL database
